## 🚀 Project Vision

> *"Data that isn’t visualized is data that isn’t seen."*

This project was envisioned to provide an **end-to-end, hands-on experience** in:

* Loading and exploring large datasets 🧾
* Cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting sales trends 📉
* Creating beautiful visual stories using Matplotlib and Seaborn 📊
* Practicing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with a robust class design 🎯
* Empowering students with real-world-ready data skills 💼

## 🧠 Behind the Code

The backbone of the project is the `SalesDataAnalyzer` class — a Python class engineered to encapsulate:

* 📥 **Data Loading:** Through the `load_data()` method, students get to experiment with real CSV files.
* 🔍 **Exploration & Cleaning:** Understand your data deeply using `explore_data()` and `clean_data()`.
* ➗ **Analysis:** The class enables statistical and mathematical insights via functions like `statistical_analysis()`, `aggregate_functions()`.
* 📊 **Visualization:** All charts are rendered interactively and can be saved using `save_visualization()`.
* 🧮 **Numpy Integration:** Convert and manipulate NumPy arrays to demonstrate indexing, slicing, and numerical operations.

All wrapped in a menu-based terminal experience that feels intuitive yet scalable.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

> Prerequisite: Python 3.8+, Jupyter Notebook (optional but ideal)

### 📦 Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

### ▶️ Run the Program

```bash
python sales_analyzer.py
```

> 📂 Load your dataset when prompted (e.g., `data/Superstore.csv`)

## 💬 FAQs & Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Why do I get a FileNotFoundError when loading my CSV?</summary>

Make sure the path you enter is **relative to the root of your project**. For example, use `data/Superstore.csv` if your CSV is inside a `data` folder.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📉 My pie chart shows wrong percentages or crashes.</summary>

Ensure your `Sales` data column contains numeric values. Also, make sure categories are not too many — pie charts work best with <10 categories.

</details>

<details>
<summary>🧮 What if my dataset has missing values?</summary>

Use the `clean_data()` method! It drops any rows with NaNs and prints before-after summaries.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📊 Where is the saved chart stored?</summary>

After you choose to save a chart, it's stored in your project root directory with the filename you provide (default `.png`).

</details>

<details>
<summary>🔄 Can I use my own dataset?</summary>

Absolutely. Just make sure it has similar columns like `Sales`, `Region`, `Profit`, `Order Date`, etc.

## 🖼 Image Upload Guide (For Mac + VS Code)

Want to include screenshots in your project?

1. 📁 **Create an `images/` folder** in the root of your project
2. 🖼 **Drag and drop PNG/JPEG images** into the `images/` folder using VS Code or Finder
3. 📝 Use **Markdown image syntax** to embed:

```md
![Alt Text](./images/demo1.png)
```

4. ✅ **Best practice**: name your images clearly like `demo1.png`, `result_chart.png`, etc.
